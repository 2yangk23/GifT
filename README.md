screen capture and upload for sharing

Creating was inspired by puush, but I wanted a way to record video rather than just take a single picture. Started out with animated .gif files originally (hence the name GifT), but later on I decided to incorporate ffmpeg to record mainly .webm files in order to capture both video and sound in higher quality and smaller file sizes. GifT was originally coded entirely in AutoIt due to me being comfortable with the language, but I plan to convert much of the program to C++ eventually.

Video recorder/Picture taker and uploader via Imgur, FTP, puush, and Dropbox with bit.ly or waa.ai as the URL shortener.

Coded in AutoIt with some C++ (dll) mainly for performance purposes.

Uses FFmpeg to record as well as curl for uploading via Imgur and puush
